My friend threw herself a big 21st birthday party at a rented venue. She invited around 30 people, and I RSVP’d yes for both me and my bf. When we arrived, there were assigned tables. I was seated at a table with my friend and her close friends. My bf was placed at a completely different table across the room with people he doesn’t know. Some mutual friends agree with her and say I should’ve just stayed quiet for the sake of the party, while others think what she did was mean and intentional. AITA? submitted by &#32; /u/unlucky_student_ and #32; [comments] AITa? &#31;/u/Unlucky.
