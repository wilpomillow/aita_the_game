    One night one of my cousins and I were up on the roof in the storage area playing, and we heard laughter and sheets rustling in a windowless room. We obviously ran crying and went to the room we were sleeping in. Since then years (decades really) have passed, both my grandparents have passed. We were all there until Wednesday because my aunt had passed away last weekend, and stayed over. Tuesday night after years we were again on the Roof during sunset. My cousin just pointed to the storage Area and just said remember what happened? She told my wife and her mom, and my mom,. and her brother about what had happened that night. I said it was the neighbors that probably made some noise if that's the case but I don't remember. She got defensive and said no it wasn't, I said we were kids then I don’t remember.
