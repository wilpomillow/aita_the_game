topCommentVerdict: "No not the asshole"

Our original agreement was she would cook and I would do the dishes. Except that every single time I did the dishes she would pretty much “check” on my work. So I finally had enough and told her that I won’t be doing dishes anymore if that’s how things will go. She said she was just trying to be helpful and that I was rude and sort of an AH for what I said and the way I said it. Or I can cook for myself and do my own dishes that she won”t get to touch (she can have her separate dishes). She said I was being rude and that she was trying to help me out. I’m still not sure what to do about it.
