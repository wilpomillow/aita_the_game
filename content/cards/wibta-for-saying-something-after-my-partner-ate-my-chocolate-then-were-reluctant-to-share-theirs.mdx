    topCommentSummary: "They should replace your nice chocolate. I don’t get how they feel at all justified in not doing that. It’s one of those ‘signs of bigger issues’ things."

    My partner has a medical condition. There is a small amount of data that suggests dark chocolate might help with their symptoms. I had about half a bar of nice chilli-flavoured dark chocolate which I only allow myself to buy while it's on offer. It was in the front pocket of a bag we both had clothes in from an overnight trip. I'd found it on offer in a supermarket where we were staying on that trip. Last night, my partner informed me they'd finished the bar of chocolate, apologised, and said they'd get me a new bar the next morning (this morning) on their walk. This morning, they came back with several bars of dark chocolate. They said it was too expensive at the shop they went to. I said fine, okay, can I have some of their stack of dark Chocolate instead? And they pause for several seconds, then reluctantly say &quot;fine, but only a bit because this is basically medicinal now. I am annoyed because they ate the rest of my nice chocolate.
