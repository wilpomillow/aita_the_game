    My husband and I come from a very different family dynamic. His family is closely integrated, they share every personal detail about one another and know no boundaries. I enjoy having my own space and I work from home, so I like to maintain my routine. Anytime they visit my routine is thrown out the window and I’m forced to do stuff with them. There’s no way I can tell him I don’t want his family visiting because he truly loves it and it makes him happy but I feel like our place has become an Airbnb and it's making me rage. I don't know what to do, am I the asshole for feelings like this? &#32; /u/Optimalillusionist [link] & #32; [comments]
