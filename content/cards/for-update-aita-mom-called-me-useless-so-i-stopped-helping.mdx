The kindness and view points from strangers on the internet helped me more than I ever expected. After I stopped helping out with the house, I reached out to my university’s student support services for advice. They helped me get a part-time job at the student help desk, which gave me a bit of financial breathing room. Around the same time, I broke up with my boyfriend. Meanwhile, my older brothers (now 25 &amp; 24) continued to do nothing to help. I went back to driving my younger siblings to school, not because I gave in, but because I genuinely care about their futures. The breaking point came when my mom tried to get my aunt (her younger sister) involved by painting me as a disrespectful daughter. I ended up telling my aunt the truth. To my surprise, she was horrified. She opened up about how she and my mom were treated pretty much the same way by my grandparents and when they moved to Australia together they talked about not raising their kids that way. Now I live with my aunt.
