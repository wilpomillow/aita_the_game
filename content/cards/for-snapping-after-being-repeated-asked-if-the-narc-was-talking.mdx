Narcissists are often asked if they are talking to them. "I question myself constantly because I don’t wanna hurt people," says one. "You just keep finding ways to be a new one," says another. "If you think every thought I have, every word I say, is manipulation then why the fuck are you still here?" says a narcissist. "My therapist is on vacation. So, AITA for snapping after being repeatedly asked if “the narc is talking”?" says one Narcissist."I was diagnosed at 16, now 28, still actively work on recognizing &amp; correcting harmful behaviors," he says. "Some think she crossed a line, others think I did. Most think I should accept more scrutiny, like I haven't already years ago"
