I 42M, have two kids living with me, my daughter Anya (17F) and my stepson Noah (14M) Noah’s mom passed a few years ago, and I’ve had full custody since. Anya is much more outgoing and has a lot of friends- she asked to have a sleepover this weekend with four of them. I said yes, of course, but given that the friends who were coming were pretty loud and have a tendency to crowd Noah, I told her to make sure they don't go into her brother's room. Also to keep things down after 11, so that the house can sleep. In my opinion, these are not strict rules. To my surprise, I came upstairs to check on them at about 10- they are 17, I didn't think I needed to checks on them every hour or something- and they were in Noah”s room. Two were literally sitting on his bed, with him there, one of them was flipping through his sketchbook, another was messing with his other stuff. They were all kind of giggling in this weird way. Noah was clearly upset, he didn't say anything/move, but there were tears in his eyes and he didn’t respond when I tried to talk to him. I told the girls to get out right then, and that I was calling every single one of their parents. I spent about 20 minutes with Noah, before he decided he wanted to cool down on his own. I went back to my daughter- who chose not to speak to
