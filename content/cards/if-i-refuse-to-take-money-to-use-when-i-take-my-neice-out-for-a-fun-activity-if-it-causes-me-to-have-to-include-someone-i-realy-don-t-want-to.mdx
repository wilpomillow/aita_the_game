    I just want it to be a Funcle (Fun Uncle) and Neice day. My mother is willing to give me money for it but I have to include something for my brother's (M-32) girlfrends daughter (F-6) I know it would not be reciprocated in future, this thought has been shown in the past to be ture. I do have the funds to easly plan and do the activates I have planed for my neice so I don't need the money and my mother was just trying to be nice but was also putting strings on it. I really want this to just be about me (Funcle) and my niece as she doesn't really get to have her own fun without someone else having to be included.
