Last week my girlfriend had a really stressful week, so I cooked her dinner. As I was setting up my uncle (52) comes into the room. He is bald and divorced, and currently living with us. He looked around at the candles and said, “This looks like something a girl would set up.” I didn’t really respond, but he followed it with, ‘You do a lot of girly stuff for a guy.’ He then said &quot;With all that girly hair stuff too, your really selling it &#32; I told him to back off, and he laughed. He got all up in my face got pissed immediately and said that I crossed a line bringing up his divorce and that I was being disrespectful.
