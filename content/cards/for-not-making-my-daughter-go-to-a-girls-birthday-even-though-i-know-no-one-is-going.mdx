This year a girl ( I will call him Emilia) joined my daughter’s school. She is very disruptive in classes and we had an issue around Halloween of her stealing peoples food at lunch. Emilia sent out invites for her birthday and my daughter doesn’t wish to go. I think she is old enough to make that type of decision. The problem is I have talked to some other parent ( my daughters friends parents) and they are not going either. It seem to be that no one will be going to Emilia’S birthday. I am torn if I should make my daughter go or not. On one hand she isOld enough to decide if she wants to go and on the other hand it would be kind to her if I made her go.
