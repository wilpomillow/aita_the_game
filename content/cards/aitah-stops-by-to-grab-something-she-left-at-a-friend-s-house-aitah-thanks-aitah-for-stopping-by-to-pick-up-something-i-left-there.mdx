    I recently had to stay at a friend's house over the weekend and earlier this week. While grabbing my stuff from her place, I accidentally left my rice cooker there. She had a friend over and was watching a football game. I parked in an illegal spot with my hazards on and had to just get in and get out. I knocked on her door twice, greeted her, met her friend, and told them I couldn't stay long because of the parking situation. I told her this twice while I was there and apologized both times. She sends me this later at almost 1am over text. Friend: Don't you ever walk in my fucking house when I have a guest over and think you can just walk all over me and not acknowledge me when I did nothing but be a good friend to you.
