    My (F22) friends(22F, 22F) and I have been friends for 4-6 years. They only work part time while I work full time. We’ve been preparing for this concert since October. I’m the only one who knows how to drive. Last time I paid all most $900 and it took them all most a month to pay me back for the hotel. Last night we texted and they did not have enough for the split of the hotel nor enough for food. (less than $150) I don’t know why it irritated me so much. So I”ve been telling them excuses like I got an overdraft or something came up just to see what they would do.
