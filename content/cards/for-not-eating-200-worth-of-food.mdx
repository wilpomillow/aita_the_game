I was visiting my boyfriend and his family in their state. We went to a restaurant where you pay for all you can eat bbq and sushi. You cook the meats there yourself and my bf ordered alot of pork and beef for us. I ordered myself chicken, shrimp, rice and veggies. I ate all of my food and made sure not to bite off more than I could chew. My bf offered me beef and I had some of that but when he offered me pork I hesitated but he gave me a stern look and I felt forced to eat a small slice. He even tried to give me more pork and trick me into thinking it was chicken thigh but I said no, I’m full. After the dinner, in the car he said he was upset he spent $200 on food and all I ate was “3 pieces of chicken” and barely touched the beef/pork. He said I was being ungrateful but I think not.
