    After surgery on her hand, her sister demanded oxycodone for chronic pain. She stormed out of the room and slammed her bedroom door. I bought a safe and put the oxycodones in it to keep it away from her. I’m thinking of flushing the pills down the toilet. My mom and other sister is on my side, the first sister and her bf think I'm an asshole so I don’t know. I don't know what to do. I'm not sure if I can do anything about it. I just want her to know that she's not the only one who is in pain. I want to make sure that she doesn't have to go through the same thing as I did. I hope she gets the help she needs.
