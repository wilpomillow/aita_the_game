All inclusive hotel has club style seating, meaning all tables are tables of 8. A family of 5 got seated at my table. The mother turned to me and said 'we do not wish to expose our children to women drinking alcohol' I smiled and said perhaps they should ask to move tables if it was an issue but I would be drinking the wine. They noticed I was on my own and made passive aggressive comments about this. I went up to get food and on return the wine had disappeared. A waiter came over and asked to see my wrist band (for the all inclusive) and said the family had told them I was underage and must have sneaked away from my parents. He was very apologetic and returned with a fresh glass of wine just as the family came back with their food.
