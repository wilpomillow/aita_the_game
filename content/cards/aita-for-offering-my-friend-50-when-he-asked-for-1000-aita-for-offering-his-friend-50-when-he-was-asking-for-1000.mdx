    My friend desperately needed 1000$ I could have given it easily, but I don't like lending money because I've had bad experiences in the past. So I told him I could give him 50$ as a gift instead, because that's the most I would give without expecting anything back. He got really offended by the small amount and called me to tell me how offensive this was to his situation. I called him ungrateful. At that point we were friends for like a year, he made it seem like we were best friends when he asked for money. I live in eastern europe btw, so this money is worth more here (but admittedly my salary is also pretty good and he knew that) &#32; submitted by /u/AgginSwaggin [link]
