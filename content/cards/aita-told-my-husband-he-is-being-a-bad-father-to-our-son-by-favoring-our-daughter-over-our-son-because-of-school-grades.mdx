    My husband has always placed a very high premium on book smarts. He's just become a bit aloof and distant now when it comes to our son. He'll want to go to school for her parent-teacher meetings but for his I'm the only one who goes. This partiality has been seeping into other stuff too. If it's a grocery run, it's her he'll ask to accompany him. If he's watching a show or a documentary, she will ask to stay up with him. He took offence to that said I was very wrong for saying that, that he's a father to both, and has his own dynamics with each kid. I couldn't really take the conversation any further because he was stuck on what I said.
