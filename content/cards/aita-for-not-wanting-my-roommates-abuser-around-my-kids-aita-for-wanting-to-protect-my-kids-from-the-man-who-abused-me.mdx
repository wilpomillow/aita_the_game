    The woman has been dependent on her ex-boyfriend since she was 13. The man has served time for it already and has been out with no further charges. The woman's husband knows about it and has stated that they are best friends. I have stated multiple times that I am uncomfortable with her having him over when the kids are there. I told her that I love her and of course want her to have what she needs but it is a definite boundary with the kids and that she needs to let me know in advance if she's going to have him over. I also said that I thought it couldn't be anything but damaging to the both of them to continue their relationship like that. Frankly I don't want to be around her either. So AITA?
