My sister is pregnant and wanted me to make the cake for her gender reveal. I asked her to send me the info so I could prep the inside-classic pink or blue filling. She says she'll have someone email the info to me later. That someone never did. Deadline comes, and I still have no gender. It's grey inside. Just full on cement vibes. I even added little fondant clouds for effect. It still tasted great, but visually? Grim as hell. Now my mom says I embarrassed her in front of the family. So... AlTA for making the most neutral reveal cake in history? Edit: I actually did follow up-asked her a couple days before the reveal if the info had been sent, and she just said something like &quot;yeah, someone's taking care of it.&quot;"
