My wife (37F) gets nervous about driving in traffic so I always drive when we visit her family. She also tends to get car sick on longer drives and needs to sit in the front seat to help ease it. On the way to her family's place she sat up front with me and traffic was pretty bad. The ride home was much easier traffic-wise and my wife sat pretty much silent in the backseat the entire time, pouting. She told me I humiliated her and that I should be more considerate of her feelings. I told her it's either that or she drives us home. When we got home she told me that she felt ill the entire drive but didn't say anything because she didn't want to make a big deal out of anything.
