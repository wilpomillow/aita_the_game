When my 3year old niece swallowed my sister’s left AirPod, everyone started worrying right away. I was trying to lighten the situation, so I connected the AirPod to my phone and put my ear on her stomach to check if I could hear it. Surprisingly, I actually did hear a little sound coming from inside her, which made the moment a bit funny for me. But the people around us didn't really find it amusing. They all looked at me like I wasn’t taking things seriously at all. I ended up being the only one laughing while everyone else was still stressing about the Air pod inside her.
