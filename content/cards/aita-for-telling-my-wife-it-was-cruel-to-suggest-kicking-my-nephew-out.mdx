    Last year my cousin's son moved here from our home country for his undergrad. He was supposed to have secured a co-op (internship) during that time for the winter. However, due to the terrible job market he hasn't of yet (he's still applying I can see him on his laptop trying) Last night my wife asked what we were going to do about him. I told her that disrupting him while he's on the job hunt would simply hurt his chances of getting one. She seemed stung on that and said I need to think of the fact I have a 14 year old daughter in the house. I got a bit heated too and said that he keeps to himself, is respectful, and she was just creating reasons when there weren't one. I'm trying to do the best for everyone here.
