My friend [19f] downloaded dating apps like Tinder and Hinge for the first time about a week ago. Since then, she's been complaining to me that almost all the men there are ugly, short, etc. I told her that these guys were all in her league and she should give some of them a chance since she always complains about wanting to be in a relationship. She denied that she's the same league as them and said she's much more attractive than them. I pointed out that in her own words, she doesn't match with any of the guys she does find attractive, so she's not in their league. She said I was an AH. Am I? &#32; submitted by &# 32; /u/Fluid_Experience866 and #32; [comments]
