The sub is not intended to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is. offline, people in your real life will think you’re an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it. So even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you're totally in the right, if everyone in yourreal life thinks you're an asshole, well… there’s probably a reason for that. I love this sub, I love reading the stories and I find it very interesting to hear people's opinions. But I personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub's judgement of who's the asshole in a given situation.
