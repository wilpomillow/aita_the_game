    A coworker has been getting on my nerves this week for coming to me often with minor problems and interrupting my work. Today she pulled me aside, conveyed some work stuff to me and then said “I’ve been interrupting you a lot this week with problems, you must think I’m really annoying” in a jokey way. She did not look happy about that reply. We parted ways without any sort of outward issue but I could tell I ruffled her feathers a bit. I feel like this coworker was fishing for some reassurance and was surprised to not get it. That said, I also feel like by agreeing with her, I may as well have just insulted her like that myself. Am I the Asshole?
