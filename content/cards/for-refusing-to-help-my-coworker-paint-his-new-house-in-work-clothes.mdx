A friend from work asked me to help him paint a house that he had just brought over. The house was a two-hour drive away and he didn't want to paint in his work clothes. I ended up not painting because he wasn't into the idea and I just went home. Since everyone’s asking he had NO STUFF at this house. He was also planning on traveling back that night. He hadn’t moved yet. &#32; /u/SilverLawfulness1588 &#31; [comments] #1: ‘I’m so glad you’re back.’ #2: � ‘You’ve been a great friend to me.” #3: “I love you,” ‘’’ ’‘”’. ‘It’ll be fine,’
