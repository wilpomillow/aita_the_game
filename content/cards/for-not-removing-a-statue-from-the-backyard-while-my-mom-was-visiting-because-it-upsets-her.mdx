My wife Cece and I live across the country from my family, so my parents have not spent a lot of time out here. This past Christmas mom and dad treated themselves to a trip out here for two weeks. A few years ago Home Depot was selling plastic statues of a folk saint called Santa Muerte. Cece likes her and built an outdoor altar where she leaves offerings and can hang out. Her mom also liked the saint, and I think this is something that connects them after her death. For the rest of the trip, Mom refused to go in the back yard and wouldn’t even stand near the windows where you can see it. She would make a big show of turning her back to the window. When they were leaving, my dad told me that he was disappointed in me for not caring that my poor mom felt scared the whole trip.
