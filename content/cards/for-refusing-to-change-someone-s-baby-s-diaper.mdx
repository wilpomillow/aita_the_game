My wife and I have been married 10+ years and have a few kids. No major complaints - they just tend to ask for people to do stuff that I would think they'd do themselves. The other day, we're having a dinner at MIL's house when the baby had a poopy diaper. My wife blamed me for making SIL feel bad and said I could've just changed the diaper. Not trying to make anyone feel bad - but I've had 3 kids and I always took responsibility -I watched them, I packed for them, and I changed them. I'm not looking to be a secondary parent for this kid.
