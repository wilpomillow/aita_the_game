My wife and I have been married 10+ years and have a few kids. No major complaints - they just tend to ask for people to do stuff that I would think they'd do themselves. The other day, we're having a dinner at MIL's house when the baby had a poopy diaper. My wife blamed me for making SIL feel bad and said I could've just changed the diaper. Not trying to make anyone feel bad - but I've had 3 kids and I always took responsibility -I watched them, I packed for them, and I changed them. I'm not looking to be a secondary parent for this kid. &#32; /u/Late4AnAppointment &# 32; [comments] #1: #2: #3: #4: #5: #6: #7: #8: #9: #10: #11: #12: #13: #14: #15: #16: #17: #18: #19: #20: #21: #22: #23: #24: #25: #26: #28: #29: #30: #31: #32: #33: #34: #35: #36: #37: #38: #39: #40: #41: #42: #43: #44: #46: #47: #48: #49: #50: #51: #52: #53: #54: #55: #56: #57: #58: #59: #60: #61: #62: #63: #64: #68: #69: #70: #72: #74: #79: #80: #81: #82: #83: #84: #88: #89: #90: #94: #99: #100: #101: #102: #104: #103: #110: #108: #109: #111
