In my daughter's school, they have a rule- if you invite the whole class and distribute invitations in class, you can't exclude only few students. My daughter, due to her condition doesn't get along with most kids in her class, she often says mean things and can be disruptive because she doesn't understand how to communicate. There's this kid in herclass- Bob (fake name) who she absolutely doesn'tget along with. Recently he was distributing invitations for his birthday party sometime next week and he invited everyone but her. This made her feel bad, expectedly so. Her special ed teacher informed me about it. She told me that since this was done in school, we could tell the school to mediate. I later got a message from her homeroom teacher to come in for a meeting with Bob's parents to discuss this situation.
