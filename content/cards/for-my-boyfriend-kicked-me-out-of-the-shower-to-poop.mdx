My boyfriend has IBS so when he's gotta go he’s gotta go. We live in a cold ass place that is heated with a wood stove and I hadn’t gotten the fire going yet so was just standing freezing and dripping and shampoo haired outside the bathroom waiting for him to shit. This is obviously not THAT big of a deal but like….am I crazy thinking that it's a wild ask to make ur partner leave mid shower so you can take a dump? &#32; submitted by &# 32; /u/yeahyeahokaygreat and #32; [comments] #1 “I’m so sorry but you have to leave right now, I gotta GO” “Dude, no. I’ll just close the shower curtain and you can go”
