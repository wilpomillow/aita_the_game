topCommentSummary: "You aren't being ridiculous, she definitely was. What she might be missing is that there is no 'fixing' an error like you described in crochet; you either start over or pull out"

I made a blanket for my sister in law Amanda. She asked for it in certain colors. When I gave it to her she was excited and she started to look it over. After a little bit she said that she loved the blanket, but she couldn’t help but notice some of the little mistakes I’d made along the way. I was honestly dumbfounded by this. I hate the way perfectionists try to force their quirk onto others. I made this blanket for her for free out of my own free time because I love her. She said she knows and she loves me for it but that she wouldn't be able to use it. I said whatever and took the blanket back and said that if she doesn't want it, I'll keep it.
