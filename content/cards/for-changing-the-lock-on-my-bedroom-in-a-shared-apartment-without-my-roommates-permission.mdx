I’ve been sharing an apartment with another woman for about three months now. She would come into my room without asking, lie on my bed, walk around the apartment barefoot. She also helped herself to my snacks and used my things. I finally asked her directly if she had a key to my room. She got defensive and said I was being paranoid and imagining things, so I dropped it. A few weeks later, when she went out with friends, I asked a friend of mine to change the lock on my bedroom door. She started sending me angry messages saying I changed the lock without her “permission,” that I disrespected her, and that building staff had questioned her about it. I officially filed a complaint against her and a notice was issued to her.
