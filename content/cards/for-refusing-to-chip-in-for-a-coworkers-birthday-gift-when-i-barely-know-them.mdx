Last week an Susan 48F went around the office saying we were all chipping in for a birthday gift for a coworker( Jenna 38F or 37F not sure ) Anyways She works in a different department than me, and while I recognize her face we’ve maybe exchanged a few hellos in the hallway. Susan (the organizer) suggested everyone pitch in $20 for a gift card and a cake.. I didn’t respond at first. Later that day, the Susan stopped by my desk and asked if I was in. Since then, a couple coworkers have been noticeably colder toward me, one even joked that I’m “that guy” (meaning who doesn’s put $20 in) , anyways I m starting to wonder if I broke some unspoken office rule and came off as cheap or antisocial.
