Bulgarian tour guide who accompanies groups to Sicily. One woman who was travelling alone (mid-30s) was consistently oversleeping. She missed the whole day trip and was furious the next day. Later she told the rest of the group that I abandoned her and also called my agency, leaving a bad review about me. AITA for not personally waking up a grown woman despite warning her multiple times I wouldn't? EDIT: I talked to my manager today!! I was already tired of this whole shenanigan and didn't want to spend ages defending myself, so I went to him first and explained the situation before he approached me. He told me, word for word, I deleted that bs from my e-mail as soon as I read it&quot; LOL! An icon. They'll remove the bad review!
