My wife (Paula ) and I just got back from a trip. It was our first time away since our twin daughter was born. We gave my mother in law Hakiko a spare key just to check on things if necessary. When her grandmother passed away, she left her two handcarved mahogany pieces a desk and a vanity. They were Paula absolute favorite things walked in yesterday and the room was empty. Hakiko was there, all smiles, saying she made a surprise for us by getting rid of that oldie dusty junk to give us a modern look. She replaced them with some cheap, flatpack furniture. She literally give away/donated Paula inheritance without asking Told her to leave and give me the keys. I changed the locks today. Paula has been in tears. Now the rest of the family are calling me abusive guy and controlling by for isolating paulas from her mother Hakiko over some old piece of junkie wood. They say Hakiko’s heart was in the right place and I'm being an AH for banning a grandmother from seeing her grandkid over furniture!
