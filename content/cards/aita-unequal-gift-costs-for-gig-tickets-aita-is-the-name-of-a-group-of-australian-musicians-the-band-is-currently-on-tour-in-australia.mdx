    topCommentSummary: "Emily needs to be told that asking for a gift that costs well over 1000 pounds is boorish. If a kid pulled that on me, I would back off on gift giving"

    Alice, 15, is a huge fan of a punk bank who happened to be playing in our city next month. Marie was happy to support her love of music and happily gifted her tickets for herself and a friend, plus cash for a t-shirt and transport home afterwards. Emily, 14, was aware of her sister's choice and said she also wanted a live music experience. But she then revealed that her choice was a trending pop artist. I checked ticket sites but there is only resale available and there's nothing under £650. Plus the artist is playing in a city several hours travel away - so trains, accommodation and food costs would inflate the final cost. When I realised the price I told her she would need to rethink her request because it was extremely expensive. Am I being unreasonable or treating either of the kids unfairly?
