My brother in-law lost his home shortly after his divorce 10 months ago. He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia &amp; Sloane18) with him. His sister (my wife) and I have one daughter (Zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren't close but get along fine. Last straw was when Zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month. One of the girls took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. I got Zoey a lock after I found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!! Sammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset.
