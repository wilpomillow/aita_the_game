    Been poorly since Xmas with nasty flu and chest infection. On my 3rd round of steroids for my chest plus inhalers. Yesterday after a long day at work (wfh) my voice had given up and I can hardly speak. My boyfriend came home around 6.30pm having finished work at 3 then been to the pub. He was chatty and wanted me to chat back. I said as best I could, I’m losing my voice and feel terrible I just want to sit quietly tonight and try to recover. He is angry at me and kicked off that I don’t want to make conversation and am uninterested. It ended in a row and him sleeping on the couch. I'm too poorly to really care right now but I think he is being terribly unfair. I literally have no voice to chat!
