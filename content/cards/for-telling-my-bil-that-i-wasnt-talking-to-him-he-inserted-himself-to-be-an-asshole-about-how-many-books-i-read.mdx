I was on the couch reading and finished up a book. I took out my bookmark and set it down on the coffee table. My mom said “What number was that?” and I said, 175. My BIL was also there and said ‘What is 175?’ I said as in 175th book I have finished this year. He started saying “prove it’ and demanding that I show him my list of books. I handed him my phone with my Goodreads. He said � “You aren’t actually reading 175 REAL books. Talk to me when you’re actually reading books with substance and not just brain candy trashy smut beach reads.” I think he said that because one of the books I read was literally called Beach Read, lol. Mind you it was one of 5 total romances I read because I don't really enjoy them.
