    I have never met my grandma from my dads side. Neither have my sisters (I have two, one younger, whos 5 and one older whos 18). None of us are close to this woman, and I hate to admit it but I don't really care for her. I figure that the reason my mom just let's her do what she wants comes down to the fact that she helps out with the bills. Because my sister has provided help via the bills, my parents are just gonna let her set her foot down on the room situation, and no one else but her will be sleeping in her own room because she said so. I have also decided to just suck it and sleep on the couch, because I really don't like my dad.
