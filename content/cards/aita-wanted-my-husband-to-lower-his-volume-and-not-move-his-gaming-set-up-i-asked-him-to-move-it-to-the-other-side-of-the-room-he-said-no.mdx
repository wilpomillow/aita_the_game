    Husband works the late shift and doesn’t get home until 11pm or midnight most nights. I work an early shift and get up at 6 am. Husband and I have our gaming set ups side by side in our bedroom. When husband games with friends he wears noise cancelling headphone with a microphone. I think he is very loud. He desperately wants and has asked on multiple occasions to move his gaming set up to our basement to preserve my sleep and also let me game in peace. I have strongly resisted this. I barely see him for an hour a day 3-4 times a week because of our opposite schedules. If he moves down to the basement to game I will see him less than ten minutes a day 5 days a week. I will only see him 1.5 hours with our kids on Tuesday and 9 hours partially with kids on Saturday since he comes home and games until the wee hours of the morning when I'm sleeping.
