She already weighs over 125 lbs and she is about 3 ft. tall. Her parents have pacified her with food her entire life. She refuses to try anything new, and her parents will make separate meals for her every time they eat. She is a wonderful little girl otherwise, and has told me about how much she is being bullied in school already because of her weight. I hate to watch them ruin this little girls life because they give in to her every whim on what she wants to eat. It's clear she has an eating disorder at 6! I made spaghetti for a group of people the other day, and this little girl, while I wasn't looking, scarfed down an entire loaf of garlic bread by herself. Garlic bread alone was 2000 calories. Never mind what else she ate that day.
