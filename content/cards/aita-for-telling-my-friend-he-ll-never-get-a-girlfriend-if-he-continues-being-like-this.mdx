    topCommentSummary: "If he's so religious he won't go to parties, his best option for finding a girlfriend is his church. Anywhere else the girls probably aren't suitable for him."
    topCommentVerdict: "No not the asshole"

    My friend (20M who we'll call Alex) has never had a girlfriend before, or even really been close to having one. He's kind of the odd one out within the friend group since the rest of us either have or at least had a relationship at some point in our lifes. But, I just don't see a way he'll ever get one if he continues certain behaviours. For example, we've invited him to a lot of parties over the years and he has refused every single invite. He doesn't talk to girls because he gets nervous around them and doesn't try to text girls on instagram because he thinks its embarrasing. He barely leaves the house, if it weren't for college and hanging out with us once or twice a month he'd be at home the entire time.
