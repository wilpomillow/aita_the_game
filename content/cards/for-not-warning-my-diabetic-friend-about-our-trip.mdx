My friend, sister, and I went out to major city near us for my birthday. At the beginning of the day i make sure to tell her I have extra snacks incase she needs to fix her blood sugars, with both fast and long acting carbs. She also has some trouble with a leg injury, but my sister has a pretty bad one that flares up and i have a minor one. I figured she would be comfortable telling us if she needed to stop. We finished the museum with about 2 hours to spare. So my sister and I say we should walk around the city since there's some cool stuff nearby. She doesn't protest, and had been sitting down for a bit previously because she was bored of the exhibit we were in. So we end up walking and taking the subway around, every time we are near a mall and even as we are walking around we are checking in with her if she needs food.
