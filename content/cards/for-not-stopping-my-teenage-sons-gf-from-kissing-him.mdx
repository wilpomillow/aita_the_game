topCommentSummary: "Your wife needs to accept that your son is growing up. Besides, kissing is not inappropriate at 17 years old. It's not like they spend their free time making out in front"
topCommentVerdict: "No not the asshole"

My (50) son (17) recently got into a car accident with a drunk driver. My family (my wifr,45 and daughter,14) got there an hour before his girlfriend? When she came in she ran to him in his hospital bed and started hugging and kissing him (mainly lips but other places on his face too) She stayed for most of the night, checking up on him and being supportive. As we were driving home that night my wife said she was upset I didn't say anything to my sons gf. I asked why I would have as she was being a good partner My wife said that it felt weird seeing that, especially Infront of his family. I told her she was worrying about the wrong thing and that anything that brought our son comfort was good.
