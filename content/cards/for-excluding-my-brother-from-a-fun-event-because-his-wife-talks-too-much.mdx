I would love for my brother (33M) to attend, but do not enjoy the company of his wife (30F) She not only dominates any conversation and is very loud (only appears to have one volume) She also rarely ask anyone questions about themselves without immediately, jumping on what they’re saying to make it about her. I have to specifically seek him out alone, if I want to talk to him at all. If they are together, she cannot stop talking for both of them and he can’t get a word in. This is not new behavior from her, and I have discussed it with him. He says he knows that it is annoying/disruptive and that he has talked to her about it, but nothing seems to change. Am I the asshole for excluding them because of her behavior?
