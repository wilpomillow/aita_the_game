    I was borrowing J’s bike as when mine broke down I needed a commuter, and he offered to lend me his bike as he doesn’t use it. I got insured, offered to pay him and he turned my money away. Cut to today. He has been calling F 10+ times daily since the accident on Tuesday. Not asking him how I’m doing, but trying to extract money from us because he is “out of pocket”. He claims insurance could take 6-12 months to pay out. He needs the bike NOW. F told him this was ridiculous and to just wait, we’re currently not in a good place emotionally, physically or financially and he would get what he was owed. Any insight would be appreciated on how to resolve this amicably, thank you.
