    I (21F) live with my roommate (22F), we split rent, and walls are thin af. She's got a new boyfriend and he's over basically every night. They’r EXTREMELY loud. Like porn soundtrack loud. I’ve asked her multiple times to keep it down, especially on work nights and she won’t listen, she pretty much laughs it off. Last week they woke me up at 2am before a 6am shift and that pretty much sent me over the edge. The next day I told her if he’s gonna pretty much live here and ruin my sleep, she needs to chill, see him less, or pay more rent. She didnt really care but when i persisted she said I was slut shaming and trying to be controlling about her life. I just want to sleep.
