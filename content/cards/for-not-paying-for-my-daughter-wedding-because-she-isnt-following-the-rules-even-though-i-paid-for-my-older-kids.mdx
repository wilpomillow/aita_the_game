My daughter (31F) is marrying Cindy ( 34F) and they have picked out a venue and are working on the guest list. My wife and I have always told all of our kids that we will be willing to pay for their wedding if they follow a few rules. All family has to be invited ( exceptions if something major happened ) The wedding can not be a destination wedding (if all your guest need to get on a plane basically and leave the country ) immediate family gets a plus one even if they are not dating someone Overall the rules are not that hard to follow in my opinion. Only my middle son/Dil. wanted an Italy wedding but decided against it after I informed them i wouldn’t pay. They can still do a child free wedding of they want, just means they wont get 50k-100k from me.
